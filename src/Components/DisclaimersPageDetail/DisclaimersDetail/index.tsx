          EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES DISCLAIMER
        </div>
        <div className="pt-[20px]">
          It is our intention to comply with the federal Fair Housing Act, which
          prohibits "any preference, limitation, or discrimination because of
          race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national
          origin, or intention to make such preference, limitation or
          discrimination." We support Equal Housing Opportunity and encourage
          users of our site to follow appropriate guidelines to comply with the
          Federal Housing Act, as well as any applicable state and local laws
          and regulations. All renters are hereby informed that all property
          rental offers are available on an equal opportunity basis. The Civil
          Rights Act of 1968, as amended by the Fair Housing Amendment Act of
          1988, provides civil rights protection to applicants and tenants of
          rented or leased housing and purchasers of residential dwelling units.
          These rights are also included in Chapter 515. Hawaii Revised Statues
          which further expands the protection provided by State law. Together,
          Federal and State laws, prohibit housing discrimination based on a
          person's RACE, COLOR, RELIGION, ANCESTRY/NATIONAL ORIGIN, SEX,
          FAMILIAL STATUS, PHYSICAL OR MENTAL DISABILITY, MARITAL STATUS, AGE,
          HIV INFECTION OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY. These are
          called the "protected classes." PROPERTY OWNER'S AND MANAGER'S
          RESPONSIBILITIES We have a responsibility and a requirement under
          federal law not to discriminate in the rental of property on the basis
          of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national
          origin. Moreover, we will not establish discriminatory terms or
          conditions in the purchase or rental of housing, deny that housing is
          available, or show any preference or limitation based on race, color,
          religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national original when
          advertising that the property is available.
